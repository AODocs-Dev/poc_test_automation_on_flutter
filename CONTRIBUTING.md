# How to contribute
- Suggestions for a better project structure will definitely be welcomed. Just ensure to argue your case in your pull request :)
- More tests for the sample apps also needed, demonstrating functionality that already isn't covered in a previous test ofcourse, remember that old cardinal rule Don't Repeat Yourself(DRY).
